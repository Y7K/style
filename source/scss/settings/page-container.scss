/**

 *
 * Page container defines a responsive container for the whole page content. It takes
 * the definitions from "settings/page-container" and creates a container with different
 * width based on breakpoint.
 *
 * - For every breakpoint, set a map
 * - Map can have two properties (either or!)
 *     - margins: XX[px/vh/%/etc.]   --> Container has fluid width and margins on the side and is centered
 *     - width: XX[px/vh/%/etc.]     --> Container has fixed width and is centered
